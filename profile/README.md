# Warewulf Overlays

This is a place to share overlays for Warewulf that do common tasks. They _may_ work just by cloning into your Warewulf overlay directory and setting whatever tags are required in your node config, but it's **highly recommended that you read them first**. 

To use an overlay from this collection:
```
cd /var/lib/warewulf/overlays
git clone https://github.com/warewulf-overlays/${OVERLAY}.git
```
