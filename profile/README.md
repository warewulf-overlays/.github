# Warewulf Overlays

This is a place to share overlays for Warewulf that do common tasks. They _may_ work just by cloning into your Warewulf overlay directory and setting whatever tags are required in your node config, but it's highly recommended that you read them first. 

The `warewulf-overlays` repo is a meta-repo that just includes all the others as submodules. It makes it easy to grab all at once while still preserving the ability to cherry pick individual overlays of interest.
